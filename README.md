This site is built with Next.js and is optimized for zero-cost hosting on **Vercel** or **Firebase**.

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

1.  **Initialize Git**:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
2.  **Add your files**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
3.  **Commit the changes**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial site launch"
    ```
4.  **Set the branch to main**:
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```
5.  **Add your remote repository**:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/dalimusashi/minimalist-gateway.git
    ```
6.  **Push the code**:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    *(Note: You might be asked to log in to GitHub at this step.)*
