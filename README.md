# Gabriel Duro | Minimalist Gateway

A premium personal landing website for Gabriel Duro.

## 🚀 Free Hosting Guide (Zero-Cost)

This site is built with Next.js, meaning you can host it for **$0.00/month** forever using these industry leaders:

### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push this code to a **GitHub** repository.
2. Sign up at [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and click **"Add New > Project"**.
3. Import your GitHub repo.
4. Add your `RESEND_API_KEY` to the **Environment Variables** in Vercel settings.
5. Click **Deploy**. Vercel provides a free SSL certificate and automatic deployments.

### Option B: Firebase App Hosting
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Connect your GitHub repo to **App Hosting**.
3. Use the **Spark (Free) Plan**. You will only stay within free limits for a personal site.

## 📧 Contact Form Setup
The form is currently set to send to:
*   **Primary**: `ahoy@vibedot.com`
*   **Secondary**: `dalimusashi@gmail.com`

**To enable emails:**
1. Create a free account at [Resend.com](https://resend.com).
2. Get your API Key and add it as an Environment Variable named `RESEND_API_KEY` on your hosting provider (Vercel/Firebase).

## 🔗 Custom Domain
