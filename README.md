# Gabriel Duro | Minimalist Gateway

A premium personal landing website for Gabriel Duro.

## 🚀 Free Hosting Guide (Zero-Cost)

This site is built with Next.js, meaning you can host it for **$0.00/month** forever using these industry leaders:

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
If you don't see a download button, use the **Terminal** in your IDE:
1. Initialize Git: `git init`
2. Add files: `git add .`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "initial commit"`
4. Create a repo on GitHub and follow their "push an existing repository" commands.

### Step 2: Host on Vercel (Recommended for $0/mo)
1. Sign up at [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and click **"Add New > Project"**.
2. Import your GitHub repo.
3. **CRITICAL**: Add your `RESEND_API_KEY` to the **Environment Variables** in Vercel settings.
4. Click **Deploy**. Vercel provides a free SSL certificate and automatic deployments.

### Step 3: Connect Custom Domain
Once deployed on Vercel, go to **Settings > Domains** to point your domain (e.g., `gabrielduro.com`) to the site. This is standard and doesn't cost extra from the host.
