# **App Name**: Minimalist Gateway

## Core Features:

- Main Statement Display: Display the main statement (e.g., 'don't be boring.') prominently, using large, responsive typography.
- Secondary Navigation: Implement minimal navigation links (Portfolio, LinkedIn, Contact) with subtle hover states.
- Cursor-Reactive Text: Make the main statement gently shift based on cursor position (parallax effect). Disable on mobile.
- Clickable Easter Egg: Implement a micro 'easter egg' where clicking the main statement cycles through alternate lines for a short duration.
- Link Redirection: Link the Portfolio, LinkedIn, and Contact elements to their final destinations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Fullscreen black (#000).
- Text color: White (#fff).
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Centered layout with generous whitespace for a clean, premium feel.
- Subtle cursor-reactive parallax effect and reversible easter egg click animation.
